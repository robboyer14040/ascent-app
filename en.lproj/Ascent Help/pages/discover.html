				<h1>Ascent - Main Features</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Ascent is designed to help cyclists, runners, and hikers train better by organizing activity data and presenting it in useful ways.  Using Ascent, you can download activity data directly from your GPS into the program, and immediately begin analysing the data as it is presented to you in various graphical and textual formats.  The "Animation" feature lets you re-play the activity so you can review in detail your performance during any segment of the activity.</p>

						<p>The Map View plots the path you followed against one of several different, selectable map types.  Maps can be zoomed or scrolled as desired.  A "heads-up" display  can be turned on that displays instantaneous data such as speed, heart rate, altitude, etc as the map animates to show your progress during the activity.</p>

						<p>The Activity View allows you to plot the activity data, such as altitude, speed, heart rate, etc against distance.  By default, it displays a shaded plot of the altitude profile, with speed and heart rate shown as solid lines.  The "peak" values for each of the data items can be displayed, and markers added indicating significant milestones encountered during the activity. The view is highly customizable, as are most things in Ascent. </p>
