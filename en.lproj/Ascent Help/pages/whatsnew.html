				<li>"Stats" pane in browser now displays lap statistics when a lap is selected</li>

				<li>Improvements to the map detail view, so that zoom and other controls work like standard map applications</li>
				
				<li>Improved "Notes" entry in the main browser, using a dedicated editing panel that supports spell checking, undo, etc.</li>
				
				<li>Added hot keys in map detail view, such as "I" for zoom in, "O" for zoom out</li>

				<li>.tcx/.hst import now imports "Notes" into activitites</li>

			</ul>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;
			<p><b>Version 1.2</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Now show pace in activity view HUD  </li>
				<li>Added preference for "enable auto-split" and "auto split threshold".  This feature allows tracks with every long in-active periods to be split into separate tracks </li>
				<li>Added general preference for universal (24-hour) time display, instead of am/pm </li>
				<li>Added appearance preferences to set colors for different text items in the browser </li>
				<li>Added speed/pace selector to activity view</li>
				<li>Modified activity view to display pace graph, peaks, etc (still need to do heads-up display)</li>
				<li>Modified detailed map view HUD to display speed + pace
				<li>Browser now supports "flat" displays of all activites, weeks, or months.  All columns can be sorted.</li>
				<li>During import, any time gap longer than 1 hour will be split into a new activity/track.  This helps when you forget to reset the Garmin GPS in between workouts.</li>
				<li>Laps now appear in the main browser, and the previous "Laps" tab has been removed.  When a Lap row is selected in the browser, it will highlight in the map overview.</li>
				<li>Much work to make sure data values align with Garmin values</li>
				<li>Added "altitude threshold" preference to eliminate extraneous noise in climb/descent readings.  Value differences less than the preference value will be ignored when computing climb or descent values.</li>
				<li>Ascent now can display data from indoor activies, e.g. activities with no GPS and/or altitude data</li>
				<li>Heart rate values of 0 are now not included in averages</li>
				<li>Ignore cadence values of "255" (signal from Edge that cadence is not available)</li>
				<li>Added code to fix missing GPS values</li>
			</ul>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;
			<p><b>Version 1.1</b></p>
			<ul>
<li>Added the ability to import .tcx and .hst files (these are the files that are exported from the Garmin Training Center application).</li>
<li>Added the ability to import and export .gpx  files (this is a standard GPS Exchange Format, supported by many companies).</li>
<li>Major work on the main browser:
			<ul>
<li>you can right-click (or control-left-click) any column header and choose which columns are displayed in the browser.</li>
<li>columns can be re-ordered by dragging their headers (all except the first column, which can never be moved).
-- column ordering and widths are stored in and retrieved from the document file.</li>
			</ul>
<li>Added "pace" display options (one of the columns that can be added to the browser).  Pace displays minutes/mile or minutes/kilometer.</li>
<li>Added "moving time" display options in the browser.  In these cases, data points for speed, duration, and pace are only used in calculations if the speed was above a certain threshold settable in Advanced Prefs.  This eliminates stopped or nearly stopped time from these calculations.</li>
<li>Added "total time in heart rate zone" displays in the browser.</li></li>
<li>Cadence values of 0 are now ignored in averages.</li>
<li>Window sizes (for each window type) are now stored in the preferences file, so they are remembered across invocations of Ascent.</li>
<li>Added a "Number of points to average" control in the Detailed Activity view, which is used by the "Average" graphs.</li>
<li>Changed some menubar menu items to have more descriptive names.</li>
			</ul>
