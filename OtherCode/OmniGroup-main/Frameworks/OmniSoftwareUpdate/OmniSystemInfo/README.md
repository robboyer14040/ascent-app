## Purpose

This is a smaller framework that just has the system information reporting functionality from OmniSoftwareUpdate (with the idea that this is usable in the Mac App Store, where the full OmniSoftwareUpdate probably isn't). The OmniSoftwareUpdate-iOS framework for iOS serves much the same purpose (and should maybe be renamed to OmniSystemInfo if this works out).
